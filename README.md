# Image Steganography in Spatial Domain: A Comparative Literature Review

This repository contains the project **"Image Steganography in Spatial Domain: A Comparative Literature Review"**, which compares techniques and algorithms for image steganography in the spatial domain based on a review of SCI articles published in 2020. The project explores various methods, evaluates their performance metrics, and discusses their strengths and weaknesses.

## Project Overview

Steganography is a method of concealing communication by hiding messages within other digital media, providing enhanced privacy and security. This project focuses on spatial domain techniques, which directly manipulate pixel values for embedding secret messages.

### Key Topics
- **Least Significant Bit (LSB) Steganography**
- **Pixel Value Differencing (PVD) Method**
- **Cryptography Techniques Combined with Steganography**
- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE) for Data Compression**

### Objectives
- To evaluate and compare recent advances in spatial domain image steganography.
- To highlight the trade-offs between security, payload capacity, and performance.
- To recommend best practices for researchers designing robust steganographic systems.

## Articles Reviewed
1. **Secure Image Steganography using LSB and Double XOR Operations**
2. **The Steganographic Approach to Data Protection Using Arnold Algorithm and PVD Method**
3. **LSB and RLE-Based Approach for Increasing Payload and Security**

## Performance Metrics
- **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR):** A measure of image quality after embedding.
- **Mean-Square Error (MSE):** A measure of error introduced during embedding.
- **Entropy and Histogram Analysis:** For evaluating the robustness of steganographic methods.

## Conclusion
The reviewed methods demonstrate unique approaches to balancing security and data embedding capacity:
- **LSB + Double XOR:** High security through double encryption.
- **PVD + Arnold Scrambling:** Enhanced robustness via chaotic image transformations.
- **LSB + RLE:** Improved payload capacity through data compression.

## Technologies
- **Python/Matlab (optional):** For simulations and algorithm implementation.
- **Image Processing Libraries:** To analyze and evaluate the steganographic techniques.
